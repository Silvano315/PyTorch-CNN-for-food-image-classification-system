## Project Overview

This repository is the sixth project of the master's degree in AI Engineering with [Profession AI](https://profession.ai), all the credits for the requests and idea go to this team. 

GourmetAI Inc., a renowned food technology company, faces increasing challenges in improving the accuracy and efficiency of food image classification systems. GourmetAI Inc. requested the development of an advanced food image classification model using deep learning techniques.

Project Benefits:
- Improved User Experience
- Optimized Business Processes
- Technology Innovation

Project Objectives:
- Augmentation Strategies: implement different augmentation techniques to enrich the dataset, improving data variability and quality.
- Network Architectures and Transfer Learning: select and implement one or more neural network architectures suitable for the problem, using transfer learning to exploit pre-trained models.
- Fine Tuning and Hyperparameters Choice: create a custom classifier, choose the hyperparameters and optimize the model through training and validation processes.
- Validation and Regularization: retraining with validation and regularization techniques to improve the model performance.
